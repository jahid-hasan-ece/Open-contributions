## ML_Module_2

In this module 2 I have learned about **machine learning model** and **algorithm**. this module is focused on only *two types* of machine learning. They are **Supervised** and **Unsupervised** learning. The supervised and unsupervised learning are also subcategorized further.

The supervised learning originates from the idea that there is a supervisor who trains the algorithm under its supervision. The supervised learning are two types. they are:
1. **Regression**
2. **Classification**
                                                

The most widely used **Supervised Learning** algorithm are:
* Linear regression
* Logistic regression
* Decision trees
* random forest
* Naive bayes
* Support vector machine
* k-nearest neighbr


The unsupervised learning works on the clustering idea that makes classes of different types  without any supervision. This method tries to find out the pattern from input data and divided them into different classes.
